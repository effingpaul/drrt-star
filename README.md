# dRRT-Star
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/urastogi885/drrt-star/blob/main/LICENSE)

## Overview
A 2D implementation of all the algorithms, such as dRRT, ao-dRRT, and dRRT*, mentioned in [Scalable and Informed Asymptotically-Optimal Multi-Robot Motion Planning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.00994.pdf).

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- Python Libraries: Numpy, Math, Copy, Time

## Run
- Open the terminal, clone the repo and switch to project directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/urastogi885/multi-robot-mpnet.git
cd multi-robot-mpnet/
```
- Make sure the project dependencies are installed.
- Now, run the 3 algorithms mentioned the dRRT* paper:
```
python dRRT.py
python aodRRT.py
python dRRT_star.py
```
- You might have to change python to python3 in the above commands depending on the alias of Python on your system.
- You can also download the compressed file via GitHub, open up the project in an IDE that supports Python, and run each of the algorithms on the IDE.
